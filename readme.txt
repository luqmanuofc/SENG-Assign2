GAME OVERVIEW

Title: 4 in a Row

Target Platform: Both - Desktop & Mobile

Game Genre: Strategy/Puzzle

Game Objective: To be the first to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

Rules of the Game:
    1. The game is played on a vertical board which has seven hollow columns and six rows.
    2. Each player has a set of discs in a distinct color.
    3. Players take turns dropping one disc from the top into any of the seven columns. The disc then occupies the lowest available space within the column.
    4. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
    5. The game ends in a tie if the entire board is filled with discs and no player has four in a row.

Game Mechanics:
    1. User Interface: At the start of the game, the board is empty. There's an arrow symbol above each column, indicating where the disc will be placed when clicked.
    2. Placing a Disc: Players can either click directly on any cell in a column or on the arrow symbol above each column. When clicked, the disc drops vertically to occupy the lowest empty space within the column.
    3. Turns: Players take turns, with each turn involving the placing of their disc in one of the columns.
    4. Win Detection: After every move, the game checks for a win condition â€“ four discs of the same color in a row in any direction.
    5. Endgame: The game ends immediately once a player gets four in a row or if the board is fully occupied without any player achieving the win condition.
